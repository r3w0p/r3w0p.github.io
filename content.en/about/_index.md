# About

## Personal Summary

🔬 I am a research software engineer working in academia on human augmentation and cyber-physical systems.

🐻 I am also interested in data science and data analytics, specifically with complex event processing and edge computing.

🧶 I have a variety of other hobbies: baking, crocheting, numismatics, beer brewing, among others.

## Profiles

I do not use any conventional social media platforms.
However, I am active on [GitHub](https://github.com/r3w0p) and I post information about my projects on this website.
