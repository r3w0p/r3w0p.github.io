# Software

Below are some of my public software projects.
They are typically developed in my spare time, with most of my software output being work related and, therefore, they are closed source.


## Research

**BoboCEP**\
A fault-tolerant Complex Event Processing engine designed for edge computing in Internet of Things systems. I have worked on this project since my PhD and continue to (slowly) work on it when I can so that it may be adapted as a Web of Things tool.\

**BirdCNN**\
A predictive model to identify four species of bird from their vocalisations. It is my contribution to a Hackster competition.\
